      "content": "Last week, Check Point researchers reported that cybercrime forums are actively using generative AI tools to automate malware creation and craft highly targeted phishing at scale.\n\nThis is not hype. It is a shift in attacker productivity. When adversaries can iterate payloads, lures, and evasion patterns in seconds, your exposure window between code change and compromise shrinks dramatically.\n\nQuestion for security teams: Who is testing your environment with the same intensity and speed as AI empowered attackers\n\nAt CurlSek, we use AI powered offensive security to continuously probe your applications and APIs, simulating attacker behavior rather than waiting for the next manual pentest cycle.\n\nSee how continuous, AI assisted VAPT works in practice at https://curlsek.ai"

      "content": "Check Point’s latest research showed something many of us have expected but now see clearly documented. Cybercriminals are operationalizing generative AI in three concrete ways:\n\n1. Rapid malware iteration\nAttackers are using AI models to generate new code variants, modify existing loaders, and experiment with different obfuscation techniques. They do not need to be expert developers anymore. They only need to ask better questions than your defenses can answer.\n\n2. Hyper targeted phishing\nInstead of copying generic phishing kits, threat actors are feeding stolen data, LinkedIn profiles, and email threads into AI systems to generate highly personalized lures. The barrier between social engineering and code execution is getting thinner with every automated campaign.\n\n3. Automated reconnaissance and reporting\nLLMs are being used to summarize leaked data, prioritize valuable records, and even generate instructions for exploitation steps. AI is not just making code. It is helping attackers make decisions faster.\n\nWhat does this mean for defenders\n\nTraditional once a year or once a quarter pentesting cannot keep up with adversaries who can run dozens of AI driven experiments per day. The testing model itself must evolve.\n\nThis is where offensive AI changes the game for defenders:\n\n- AI driven payload generation can explore your application logic, authentication flows, and API surface area in a way that more closely mirrors modern attackers.\n- Automated reasoning can chain small misconfigurations into exploitable attack paths that human testers might miss under time constraints.\n- Continuous testing instead of point in time exercises gives you visibility into how each new feature, hotfix, or configuration change affects your real attack surface.\n\nCurlSek was built precisely for this new reality. Our AI powered offensive security platform combines traditional VAPT methodology with automated attack generation and continuous validation. The goal is not more reports. The goal is fewer exploitable paths before adversaries supported by AI find them.\n\nIf you are interested in seeing how AI can work on the defensive side of the red team blue team equation, visit https://curlsek.ai and explore how continuous, intelligent VAPT fits into your security program."

      "content": "Slide 1\nTitle: AI is now part of the attacker toolkit\nBody: Check Point’s recent investigation into cybercrime forums confirms that generative AI is being used to write malware, customize phishing, and analyze stolen data. The attacker skill bar is dropping. Their speed is not.\n\nSlide 2\nTitle: From copy paste malware to AI generated variants\nBody: Instead of reusing the same commodity malware, attackers now ask AI models to create new loaders, adjust encryption routines, or tweak indicators. Signature based defenses are the first casualties of this shift.\n\nSlide 3\nTitle: Phishing that actually sounds like your colleagues\nBody: With access to breached mailboxes and public profiles, criminals feed context into AI systems and generate emails that match tone, vocabulary, and even work patterns. User awareness alone cannot carry this load.\n\nSlide 4\nTitle: Why point in time pentests fall short\nBody: Manual pentests are valuable but episodic. Meanwhile, AI powered attackers iterate daily. The gap between tests becomes the window of opportunity for compromise.\n\nSlide 5\nTitle: Offensive AI for defenders\nBody: Imagine a testing engine that continuously crafts new payloads, explores business logic, and revalidates vulnerabilities every time your code or configuration changes. That is what AI powered offensive security brings to your stack.\n\nSlide 6\nTitle: What CurlSek delivers\nBody: - AI assisted VAPT across web apps and APIs\n- Continuous penetration testing, not just annual exercises\n- Human expert validation for high quality findings\n- Actionable remediation guidance aligned to real attack paths\n\nSlide 7\nTitle: Get ahead of AI enabled threats\nBody: Attackers already use AI to probe you. It is time to use AI to probe yourself first. Learn how CurlSek can modernize your offensive security practice at https://curlsek.ai"

      "content": "Title: When attackers bring AI to the fight, how do you respond\n\nHook 0 to 10 seconds\nOver the past week, Check Point shared evidence of criminal forums using generative AI to write malware and build tailored phishing campaigns. If attackers are using AI to scale their operations, can you really rely on a once a year pentest\n\nContext 10 to 30 seconds\nHere is what the research shows. Threat actors are:\n- Generating new malware variants on demand\n- Using AI to personalize lures based on stolen data\n- Automating reconnaissance and decision making across breaches\n\nThey are running hundreds of small experiments, very quickly. Every experiment is a new way to reach your users or your applications.\n\nProblem framing 30 to 55 seconds\nThe problem is that most organizations still test their defenses in a slow, manual way. You schedule a pentest, wait weeks for results, remediate some issues, and then hope you are still safe months later while your environment continues to change.\n\nMeanwhile, adversaries with AI are probing your systems every day.\n\nSolution 55 to 85 seconds\nAt CurlSek, we think offensive security needs to match attacker speed.\n\nOur platform combines experienced security researchers with AI driven attack generation. We continuously test your web applications and APIs, simulate AI empowered attackers, and surface real exploitable paths before someone on a forum finds them.\n\nThis is not about replacing humans. It is about giving them an engine that never sleeps and never stops exploring new angles.\n\nCall to action 85 to 100 seconds\nIf you want to see what AI powered VAPT and continuous penetration testing look like in your own environment, visit https://curlsek.ai.\n\nSet up a session with our team and let us show you how to turn AI from an attacker advantage into a defender advantage."

      "content": "Check Point’s recent research on criminal adoption of generative AI aligns with several quantitative trends we are seeing across offensive security work.\n\n1. Shorter time to first exploit\nIn recent CurlSek engagements, we have observed that once an exposed endpoint is identified, AI assisted payload crafting can produce a working exploit chain in hours, not days. In one case, an authentication bypass in an API gateway was discovered and validated in under 90 minutes using AI guided fuzzing combined with human review.\n\n2. Growth in business logic abuse\nStatic scanners focus on known vulnerability classes. AI assisted attackers and testers, however, excel at exploring unconventional workflows. Over the last quarter, more than 40 percent of high impact findings surfaced by CurlSek involved misuse of legitimate features, such as chaining discount codes or abusing workflow transitions, rather than classic injection bugs.\n\n3. Rising variance in phishing content\nWhere older phishing campaigns reused templates, we are now seeing hundreds of small content variations generated by AI. This drastically reduces the effectiveness of rule based email filters and signature oriented defense.\n\nThese data points reinforce a key assumption. The attack surface is no longer just about missing patches. It is about how quickly you can discover the same creative paths that AI enabled attackers are exploring.\n\nCurlSek’s platform is designed to measure and compress that discovery gap. By combining AI generated attack scenarios with continuous testing, we help security teams move from reactive patching to proactive exposure management.\n\nIf you want to benchmark your current security posture against AI scale threats, start a conversation with us at https://curlsek.ai."

      "content": "One of the most important insights from the latest Check Point report on AI in cybercrime is not that attackers are using generative models. It is how they are using them.\n\nThey are not relying on AI to perform entire attacks end to end. They are using it as a force multiplier in three specific places: idea generation, code iteration, and decision support.\n\nDefenders should do the same.\n\nIdea generation\nAI can rapidly suggest potential abuse cases for a given feature or API. Instead of a tester inventing ten scenarios, they can explore hundreds and then prioritize.\n\nCode iteration\nExploit development is no longer limited by how quickly a human can refactor payloads or adjust encoding. An AI agent can handle countless variations, while the human analyst steers the exploration and validates impact.\n\nDecision support\nWhen a scan surfaces thousands of low level issues, an AI system can help group them into meaningful attack paths and propose remediation sequences that reduce real risk, not just ticket volume.\n\nAt CurlSek, we explicitly design our offensive workflows around these leverage points. AI handles breadth. Human experts handle depth and judgment. Together, they deliver continuous, high value VAPT that maps to how modern attackers really operate.\n\nIf you are rethinking how to integrate AI into your own security strategy, both defensively and offensively, take a look at how we approach it at https://curlsek.ai."

      "content": "This week we focused on a single theme inspired by Check Point’s recent findings on generative AI in cybercrime ecosystems: attackers are already using AI as a productivity engine.\n\nKey takeaways from the week\n\n- AI is lowering the bar for malware creation and phishing, while increasing attacker speed.\n- Point in time pentests cannot keep pace with adversaries who can generate new payloads and lures in minutes.\n- Offensive AI is not about replacing security researchers. It is about amplifying their reach across your entire attack surface, continuously.\n- Data from real engagements shows that AI assisted testing uncovers more business logic flaws and complex attack paths than traditional tooling alone.\n- The most effective security programs will mirror how attackers use AI, embedding it in idea generation, code iteration, and decision support.\n\nThe central question remains\nIf attackers armed with AI are probing your environment every day, who is probing it on your behalf with the same intensity\n\nCurlSek exists to answer that challenge. Our AI powered offensive security platform delivers continuous VAPT and penetration testing that keeps up with the pace of modern threat actors.\n\nIf you missed any of the posts this week or want to dive deeper into how this works in practice, visit https://curlsek.ai and explore how we can help you turn AI from a risk amplifier into a defensive advantage."
