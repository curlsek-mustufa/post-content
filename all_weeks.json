Multimodal AI\nThe attackers did not rely on a single channel. They combined voice cloning, realistic video avatars, and convincing scripts. This bypassed the instinctive checks employees use when reading an email or chat message.\n\n2. Operational maturity\nThe social engineering playbook looked more like a project plan than a random scam. Attackers gathered org charts, communication patterns, and meeting formats. Then they orchestrated a coordinated call that mirrored the companys real processes for financial approval.\n\n3. Exploiting trust in workflows\nThe victim followed process as they understood it. The missing layer was a validation step robust enough to survive synthetic humans.\n\nWhat does this mean for security teams?\n\nTraditional penetration tests rarely model attacks that mix synthetic identities, human decision-making, and control bypass. They focus on network exploits and web app vulnerabilities, but they leave socio-technical workflows untested.\n\nOffensive security needs to evolve into adversary operations testing that includes:\n- AI generated lures tailored to your executives and processes\n- Simulated deepfake calls and approvals\n- Continuous discovery of weak controls around high-value actions like payments and data access\n\nAt CurlSek, we are building exactly this class of testing. Our AI-powered offensive engine can:\n- Enumerate business processes from public and internal data\n- Auto-generate realistic attack paths, from phishing to synthetic meetings\n- Continuously probe your controls without waiting for an annual assessment\n\nIf a deepfake CFO called your team today, how confident are you that process and controls would stop the transfer every time?\n\nSee how CurlSek can operationalize these attack simulations for your organization.

This was not a sci-fi demo. It was a successful operation against a mature company.\n\nProblem Framing (30 to 70 seconds)\nMost organizations are still designing their defenses around old assumptions:\n- Attacks arrive via suspicious emails.\n- The human eye can tell real from fake.\n- Annual penetration tests are enough to validate controls.\n\nBut AI is now lowering the cost of realistic impersonation to almost zero. Attackers can synthesize voices, faces, and behaviors that look close enough to fool employees under pressure. When your approval workflows rely on a quick call or a familiar face on a screen, your risk profile has fundamentally changed.\n\nInsight (70 to 120 seconds)\nThe lesson from this deepfake heist is not just that AI can be abused. It is that our testing methodology is stuck in a pre AI world.\n\nIf your offensive security assessments do not:\n- Simulate AI crafted lures and synthetic identities,\n- Probe high value workflows like payments and admin access,\n- Run continuously as your environment and attackers evolve,\nthen you are validating yesterday's threats.\n\nCurlSek Approach (120 to 170 seconds)\nAt CurlSek, we build AI powered offensive security tools designed for this new reality. Our platform can:\n- Map your business processes and approval chains.\n- Generate and execute realistic attack scenarios, including AI enhanced social engineering.\n- Provide continuous penetration testing that updates as your attack surface changes.\n\nThe result is not just a report, but a living view of how an adversary would actually move through your organization today.\n\nCall to Action (170 to 200 seconds)\nIf a deepfake executive demanded an urgent transfer tomorrow, would your controls catch it in time?\n\nTo see how CurlSek can help you test and harden your defenses against AI enabled attacks, visit https://curlsek.ai and request a demo."

          "content": "The deepfake conference call fraud is more than a headline. It is data.\n\nLet us break down what this incident reveals about the economics of AI enabled attacks and what that means for your security program.\n\n1. Cost of Impersonation Has Collapsed\nA few years ago, producing a convincing fake video of an executive required a studio-level budget. Today, freely available tools can generate high quality synthetic voices and faces from publicly available recordings in hours.\n\nEconomic impact: The marginal cost for attackers to scale from one to one hundred impersonation attempts is close to zero. That means your organization is not protected by obscurity or size.\n\n2. Detection Lag Is Measurable\nReports indicate the fraud was only discovered after the funds had moved through multiple accounts. That delay is a critical metric for defenders.\n\nKey takeaway: Your mean time to detect for financially relevant anomalies must be shorter than the attackers time to cash out. Continuous attack simulation is one way to measure this delta.\n\n3. Control Weakness Is Process, Not Technology\nNo advanced exploit was required. The attack worked because process level controls trusted a visual and auditory cue without independent verification.\n\nData point: In many organizations, secondary approval or callback verification is policy but not enforced or tested.\n\n4. Offensive Testing Gap\nMost security testing programs cannot currently answer questions like:\n- How easy is it to socially engineer a payment using synthetic identities?\n- Which teams are most vulnerable to convincingly faked executives?\n- How often do we verify large transactions out of band?\n\nThis is where AI powered offensive security platforms like CurlSek come in. We can:\n- Model your actual processes and simulate realistic attacks against them.\n- Track detection and response metrics during controlled tests.\n- Provide quantified risk reduction guidance, not just qualitative findings.\n\nIf you want your metrics to reflect modern attacker capabilities, your testing must evolve accordingly.\n\nStart by exploring how CurlSek can embed continuous, AI aware penetration testing into your environment.

          "content": "One underappreciated insight from the recent deepfake heist is that AI does not have to break cryptography or exploit zero days. It only needs to exploit assumptions.\n\nIn many enterprises, there is an implicit chain of trust:\n- If I see my executives face and hear their voice, the request is legitimate.\n- If a meeting is scheduled on the official calendar, it is safe.\n- If colleagues appear present and aligned, I should not slow things down.\n\nAI allows attackers to weaponize each of these assumptions at scale. That demands a change in how we think about offensive security.\n\nRather than simply asking, Can someone break into our network, we should be asking:\n- Which human assumptions can be turned against us with AI?\n- How resilient are our processes when identity cues are untrustworthy?\n- What happens when every approval workflow is stress tested by a synthetic adversary?\n\nAt CurlSek, our philosophy is that security testing must anticipate the next normal, not the last incident. By embedding AI into our offensive tooling, we can:\n- Automatically generate realistic social and technical attack chains.\n- Continuously uncover where human and machine trust is misplaced.\n- Give you a prioritized roadmap to strengthen controls before real attackers find the same gaps.\n\nIf your threat models and testing methodologies still assume that people can reliably spot the fake, it is time to revisit them.\n\nSee how CurlSek can help you transition to AI aware offensive security at https://curlsek.ai"

AI has industrialized social engineering\nAttackers can now create highly realistic synthetic voices and faces to impersonate executives and colleagues. The cost to do so is dropping rapidly, making these attacks accessible to a wider range of threat actors.\n\n2. The weakest link is often process design\nThe fraud succeeded because approval workflows trusted visual and auditory cues without strong independent verification. Technology alone did not fail; the overall socio technical system did.\n\n3. Traditional penetration testing is not enough\nAnnual tests that focus solely on infrastructure and web apps cannot model the full AI enhanced attack surface. They rarely simulate synthetic identities or end to end business process compromises.\n\n4. Offensive security must become continuous and AI aware\nWe need testing that accounts for evolving attacker capabilities, probes workflows as well as networks, and updates dynamically as your environment changes.\n\n5. CurlSek is built for this new reality\nOur AI powered offensive security platform can simulate adversary operations, including AI driven social engineering, and deliver continuous penetration testing tailored to your organization.\n\nIf this weeks discussion made you question whether your controls could withstand a deepfake enabled attack, that is a sign your testing strategy needs an upgrade.\n\nClose the gap between todays attackers and yesterdays assessments.

          "content": "Check Point’s latest research showed something many of us have expected but now see clearly documented. Cybercriminals are operationalizing generative AI in three concrete ways:\n\n1. Rapid malware iteration\nAttackers are using AI models to generate new code variants, modify existing loaders, and experiment with different obfuscation techniques. They do not need to be expert developers anymore. They only need to ask better questions than your defenses can answer.\n\n2. Hyper targeted phishing\nInstead of copying generic phishing kits, threat actors are feeding stolen data, LinkedIn profiles, and email threads into AI systems to generate highly personalized lures. The barrier between social engineering and code execution is getting thinner with every automated campaign.\n\n3. Automated reconnaissance and reporting\nLLMs are being used to summarize leaked data, prioritize valuable records, and even generate instructions for exploitation steps. AI is not just making code. It is helping attackers make decisions faster.\n\nWhat does this mean for defenders\n\nTraditional once a year or once a quarter pentesting cannot keep up with adversaries who can run dozens of AI driven experiments per day. The testing model itself must evolve.\n\nThis is where offensive AI changes the game for defenders:\n\n- AI driven payload generation can explore your application logic, authentication flows, and API surface area in a way that more closely mirrors modern attackers.\n- Automated reasoning can chain small misconfigurations into exploitable attack paths that human testers might miss under time constraints.\n- Continuous testing instead of point in time exercises gives you visibility into how each new feature, hotfix, or configuration change affects your real attack surface.\n\nCurlSek was built precisely for this new reality. Our AI powered offensive security platform combines traditional VAPT methodology with automated attack generation and continuous validation. The goal is not more reports. The goal is fewer exploitable paths before adversaries supported by AI find them.\n\nIf you are interested in seeing how AI can work on the defensive side of the red team blue team equation, visit https://curlsek.ai and explore how continuous, intelligent VAPT fits into your security program."

The attacker skill bar is dropping. Their speed is not.\n\nSlide 2\nTitle: From copy paste malware to AI generated variants\nBody: Instead of reusing the same commodity malware, attackers now ask AI models to create new loaders, adjust encryption routines, or tweak indicators. Signature based defenses are the first casualties of this shift.\n\nSlide 3\nTitle: Phishing that actually sounds like your colleagues\nBody: With access to breached mailboxes and public profiles, criminals feed context into AI systems and generate emails that match tone, vocabulary, and even work patterns. User awareness alone cannot carry this load.\n\nSlide 4\nTitle: Why point in time pentests fall short\nBody: Manual pentests are valuable but episodic. Meanwhile, AI powered attackers iterate daily.

If attackers are using AI to scale their operations, can you really rely on a once a year pentest\n\nContext 10 to 30 seconds\nHere is what the research shows. Threat actors are:\n- Generating new malware variants on demand\n- Using AI to personalize lures based on stolen data\n- Automating reconnaissance and decision making across breaches\n\nThey are running hundreds of small experiments, very quickly. Every experiment is a new way to reach your users or your applications.\n\nProblem framing 30 to 55 seconds\nThe problem is that most organizations still test their defenses in a slow, manual way.

          "content": "Check Point’s recent research on criminal adoption of generative AI aligns with several quantitative trends we are seeing across offensive security work.\n\n1. Shorter time to first exploit\nIn recent CurlSek engagements, we have observed that once an exposed endpoint is identified, AI assisted payload crafting can produce a working exploit chain in hours, not days. In one case, an authentication bypass in an API gateway was discovered and validated in under 90 minutes using AI guided fuzzing combined with human review.\n\n2. Growth in business logic abuse\nStatic scanners focus on known vulnerability classes. AI assisted attackers and testers, however, excel at exploring unconventional workflows. Over the last quarter, more than 40 percent of high impact findings surfaced by CurlSek involved misuse of legitimate features, such as chaining discount codes or abusing workflow transitions, rather than classic injection bugs.\n\n3. Rising variance in phishing content\nWhere older phishing campaigns reused templates, we are now seeing hundreds of small content variations generated by AI. This drastically reduces the effectiveness of rule based email filters and signature oriented defense.\n\nThese data points reinforce a key assumption. The attack surface is no longer just about missing patches. It is about how quickly you can discover the same creative paths that AI enabled attackers are exploring.\n\nCurlSek’s platform is designed to measure and compress that discovery gap. By combining AI generated attack scenarios with continuous testing, we help security teams move from reactive patching to proactive exposure management.\n\nIf you want to benchmark your current security posture against AI scale threats, start a conversation with us at https://curlsek.ai."

It is how they are using them.\n\nThey are not relying on AI to perform entire attacks end to end. They are using it as a force multiplier in three specific places: idea generation, code iteration, and decision support.\n\nDefenders should do the same.\n\nIdea generation\nAI can rapidly suggest potential abuse cases for a given feature or API. Instead of a tester inventing ten scenarios, they can explore hundreds and then prioritize.\n\nCode iteration\nExploit development is no longer limited by how quickly a human can refactor payloads or adjust encoding. An AI agent can handle countless variations, while the human analyst steers the exploration and validates impact.\n\nDecision support\nWhen a scan surfaces thousands of low level issues, an AI system can help group them into meaningful attack paths and propose remediation sequences that reduce real risk, not just ticket volume.\n\nAt CurlSek, we explicitly design our offensive workflows around these leverage points. AI handles breadth. Human experts handle depth and judgment.
